# YieldBlox Governance Proposals (YGPs)

YGPs are non-recurring YieldBlox governance proposals. They serve as a way for the community to share, discuss, and create governance proposals that help shape YieldBlox.

## YGP Status Terms

### Primary Workflow

- **Draft** — A YGP that is currently open for consideration and actively being discussed.
- **Voting** — A YGP that was created on chain, and is being voted on by the YieldBlox governance contract.
- **Accepted** — A YGP that has been approved by governance, and is queued for implementation.
- **Implemented** - A YGP that has been implemented with the protocol version specified in the YAP.
- **Rejected** - A YGP that has been formally rejected by the YieldBlox governance contract, and will not be implemented.
- **Closed** - A YGP that was closed by the creator before being voted on.
